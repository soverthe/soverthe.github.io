<h1>How to play "Adventures of FF Island" (April 2021):</h1>

<h2>Install Minecraft Forge for the 1.16.5 version (it might work in newer versions but I haven't tested it)</h2>
	-(Inside the Minecraft Launcher) Select Installations > New installation > Version > release 1.16.5
	-Run the game in 1.16.5 and press "Quit Game" when you see the menu (this is needed for generating the version file)
	-Google "forge 1.16.5" and download the installer (press "Skip" after 5 seconds, don't pay attention to the ad)
	-Run the .jar and select "Install client" (it should have the correct Minecraft folder at the bottom, change it if it's wrong)
	-After it's done, restart the Minecraft Launcher, and select the forge 1.16.5 version in the bottom left (where you select versions) (it might be at the very bottom of the list)

<h2>Download "CC: Tweaked" 1.16.5 and put it in your "mods" folder ( \AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods )</h2>
	-Download CC: Tweaked for the version 1.16.5, here's the curseforge link: <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked/files/4395617">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked/files/4395617</a> (click "Download")
	-Put the .jar file in your mods folder and make sure no other mods are there (of it they're there than have them be for the same version of Minecraft)
	-(you can find your mods folder like this (at least in windows): search %appdata%, click .minecraft, and open the mods folder (make one if there isn't one))
	-Run Minecraft

<h2>Make a computer with the biggest monitor possible in a minecraft world:</h2>
	-Select Singleplayer > Create New World > (Game Mode: Creative) > (name the world something you'll remember in a few minutes) > Create New World
	-Open your inventory and search for an "Advanced Computer" and an "Advanced Monitor"
	-Find a flat area and make a horizontal line of Advanced Monitors at the max length (8 blocks, they should all be connected)
	-Do that 5 more times on top of each other to make a 8x6 monitor where all of them are connected
	-Put the Advanced Computer to the lower left side of the monitors, touching the lower left monitor from the left

<h2>Load the ff game into the computer:</h2>
	-Open the computer (right click)
	-Type "edit ff" (and then press Enter)
	-Press Ctrl and "Save" (with Enter), then Press Ctrl and "Exit" (navigate with the arrows or with the mouse)
	-Exit the computer (Esc)
	-Open the folder for your world (go back from the mods folder to .minecraft, and select "saves" and open the folder with the name you gave for the world)
	-Open the "computercraft" folder, then "computer", 0 (as long as you didn't make multiple computers), and replace ff.lua with the ff.lua you downloaded from the GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/soverthe/soverthe.github.io/blob/main/ff.lua">here</a>)

<h2>Play the game</h2>
	-Go back in the computer and type "ff" and press Enter, and have fun!
	-You can see the possible inputs up top and you can see pictures on the monitors, also you can type "ddww" for example to go 2 left and 2 up and stuff like that
	-Oh and if a text is like {this} then it's a possible input as well
